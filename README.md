The Back End and Data Processing Pipeline for the MIT Libraries Open Access Statistics Project.

This product includes GeoLite2 data created by MaxMind, available from http://www.maxmind.com. The GeoLite2 database included here is only used for unit tests and is not kept up to date. You should manage the GeoLite2 database separately for production.

The user agent strings used for bot filtering were taken from http://user-agent-string.info/. They were stripped from the XML data file for UASparser to make loading easier.
